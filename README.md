Hi thank you for looking at my Python project that I created using Codecademy. I don't have much experience but I have been learning online to produce this project. 
It includes classes, constructors, dictionaries, dot notations, lists, and more.
It was quite challenging to create but was enjoyable. The purpose of the project is to store information about menus, locations, calculating bill, and opening times of restaurants, as well as the ability to add more.
I also have been doing some learning on Java and JavaScript but as of now I haven't got any projects to show.
